1. What is the difference between commit and push?

Commit saves changes to your local repository as a tracked snapshot with a description. Push sends those local commits to a remote repository such as Github to share or back up work.

2. Why are branches important?

Branches isolate work to protect the main codebase’s stability, enable parallel development on multiple tasks, allow safe experimentation, simplify code reviews, and support managing different versions or releases.

3. What causes merge conflicts?

Merge conflicts occur when the same part of a file is modified differently in two branches being merged, and Git cannot automatically decide which change to keep. This includes conflicting edits on the same lines, mismatched file additions or deletions, or clashing formatting changes.
